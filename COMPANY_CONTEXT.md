A: All data is hosted on your own cloud infrastructure. We never store candidate data on our servers. Full encryption in transit and at rest, with complete audit trails.

A: No. Rakri AI scores and ranks candidates, but human recruiters always make final decisions. In Level 1 mode, every AI suggestion is reviewed by a human. Level 2 automation only handles shortlisting based on your predefined criteria.

**Q: How does explainable AI work?**
A: Every candidate score comes with detailed breakdown showing exactly which qualifications, skills, experience, and factors influenced the score. No black-box decisions.

**Q: What integrations are supported?**
A: LinkedIn, WordPress career sites, custom portals, and most major ATS systems. Custom integrations available during setup.

**Q: Is this compliant with EU AI Act?**
A: Yes. Our explainable AI approach and human-in-the-loop design align with EU AI Act requirements for high-risk AI systems in employment.
